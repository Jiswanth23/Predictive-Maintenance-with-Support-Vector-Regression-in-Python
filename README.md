# Predictive-Maintenance-with-Support-Vector-Regression-in-Python
Predictive Maintenance with Support Vector Regression (SVR) in Python involves using historical sensor data to predict equipment failures. SVR models help schedule maintenance proactively, reducing unexpected downtime, improving efficiency, and extending machine life. Python libraries streamline data processing and modeling.
